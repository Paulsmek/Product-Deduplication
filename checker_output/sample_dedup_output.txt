The diode array can safely absorb up to 20A per IEC 61000-4-5 2nd Edition (tP=8/20μs) without performance degradation and can handle a minimum of ±30kV ESD per IEC 61000-4-2. The low loading capacitance of 3.5pF per I/O and a low leakage current of 1μA (MAX) at 3.3V make it particularly suitable for high-speed signal pins. The SP3304N series is RoHS compliant, lead-free, and halogen-free, ensuring it meets stringent environmental and safety standards. It also features ESD, IEC 61000-4-2, ±30kV contact, and ±30kV air ESD protection, as well as IEC 61000-4-4 EFT protection up to 40A (tP=5/50ns) and IEC 61000-4-5 2nd Edition lightning immunity up to 20A (tP=8/20μs). The diode array is designed for various applications, including 10/1000 Ethernet interfaces, customer premise equipment (CPE), VoIP phones, set-top boxes, PBX systems, and small cells. The SP3304N series is available in different models, such as SP3304NUTG, which features a 3.3V voltage rating, 0.5A leakage current, and a low capacitance of 3.5pF per I/O. This model is bidirectional and packaged in a 3.5uDFN3020-10L package. The diode array is designed to be used in environments where high reliability and protection against surge and ESD are critical. It is suitable for a wide range of industries, including automotive, consumer electronics, and telecommunications.

These blinds are engineered to absorb resonance, filter light, and improve comfort by reducing noise and heat. They are hung in front of a glazed surface and are available in various colors, including MR350 (Granit), MR980 (Graphite), MR520 (Craie), MR630 (Chiné naturel), MR130 (Chiné brun), MR120 (Chiné noir), MR150 (Chiné graphique), MR330 (Vieux rose), MR320 (Rose rubis), MR620 (Brique), MR470 (Rouge), MR370 (Bleu menthe), MR360 (Bleu étang), MR340 (Océan), MR310 (Bleu nocturne), MR660 (Lichen), MR550 (Prairie), MR480 (Fougère), MR650 (Vert beige), MR670 (Cumin), MR920 (Moutarde), MR580 (Ivoire), MR930 (Beige), MR680 (Taupe), MR640 (Nacre), MR950 (Silex), MR700 (Quartz), and MR300 (Gris pierre). The blinds are made from 3-mm thick black felt, which is protected on both sides by Aeria sound-transparent fabric, known for its acoustic, thermal, and light occluding properties. The slats are 133 mm wide, 5 mm thick, and can extend up to 3 meters in length, with a weight of approximately 0.20 kg per linear meter. The fabric cover has a durability of 330 g/m² and offers protection against soiling with a hydro/oleophobic rating of ≥ 5 (AATCC118 and AATCC193). The electrostatic properties are rated at 10^7 (EN 1149-1). The acoustic performance includes a sound absorption coefficient of 0.40 (H) at 90° and 0.45 (MH) at 180°, with a NRC of 0.30 and 0.50 respectively, classified as class D. The heat and light barrier performance includes 96% reduction in light levels, absorption of >95% of visible spectrum wavelengths (380-800 nm), and 24% thermal reflection. The solar radiation spectrum absorption is >74% with 24% reflection and <2% transmission. The environmental characteristics include 90% recycled materials in the sound-absorbing felt wadding and compliance with VOC and formaldehyde emissions standards (ISO 16000). The blinds qualify for French “A+” health labelling and are classified as “conforming” after assessment using the German AgBB protocol. They also score 2 points for Very low VOC emissions and formaldehyde emissions under LEED / BREEAM standards. The product is fire-resistant, run-resistant, antistatic, and dust-proof, with a 10-year guarantee. The blinds are designed to be hung from a rail and can be cleaned by vacuuming. An optional headrail is available with a 2-year guarantee. The product is manufactured to order, with a standard manufacturing time of 3 weeks for most products, and non-standard products take from 5 weeks.
